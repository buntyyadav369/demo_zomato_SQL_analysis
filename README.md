# demo_zomato_SQL_analysis

I have extracted some situation based answered that are generally queried in the real world scenario.

from ex:

We have created database zomato and then inserted tables with different informations related to the sales, users, product, etc.

Then we have answered 10 questions which are like this:
-- 1 what is the total amount each customer spent on the zomato?
-- 2 How many days has each customer visted zomato?
-- 3 what was the first product purachased by customer?
-- 4 what is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times it was purchased by all customer?
-- 5 which item was most popular for each customer?
-- 6 which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a gold member?
-- 7 which item was purchased by the customer just before they became a gold member?
-- 8 what is the order and amount spent by each member befor they became gold member?
-- 9 If buying each product generates points eg: 5rs =2 points and each product has different purchasing points 
     for eg: product 1 -> 5rs. =1 point , product 2 -> 10rs. =5, product 3 -> 5rs. =1 point,
     calculate points collected by each user and for which products most points have been given till now?
     
-- 10 In the first one year after a customer  joins the gold program ( including thier joining date) irrespective 
      of what the customer has purchased they earn 5 zomato points for every 10rs spent. Who earned more 1 and 3,
      what was there points earning in thier first year?
